                | Would you give your bank credentials to Mark Zückerberg?

                This is what asked me Benjamin André, Cozy Cloud CEO, when I
                met him the first time.
                He was introducing me to the Cozy project, a self-hosted
                personal cloud. So, would I give my bank credentials to a
                company of which business model is to sell its user's data? I
                have a lot of respect for Mark Zückerberg as an entrepreneur
                and I'm a Facebook addict, but my answer is no. 
            p.
                I don't know how it is for you but I have always felt
                uncomfortable to give my data to Mint-like services. And
                thinking that some day these services will probably be acquired
                by Facebook/Google/Amazon/Whatever totally freaks me out.

                I'm a freelancer and I spend too much money in my servers. I
                needed a tool to fetch my operations from my bank accounts and
                to provide me services on top of this data.

                A trustworthy finance manager was missing.
            p.
                When Cozy hired me the first time, it was to prototype a
                webmail for their platform. I enjoyed working with them so when
                they contact me to build a trustworthy money manager app for one of
                their client, I immediately started to work on
                it. The tough part came from the fact that banks don't provide 
                any APIs to access to my data. Fortunately, I discovered an
                awesome FOSS project called Weboob, that allows you to scrap
                data from the web and specially from bank websites. What makes
                it wonderful is that bank connectors are easy to build and are
                maintained by their community.

        .third-step-next
            p.image-text.
                I convinced the Cozy team to
                integrate Weboob in the core stack. They accepted, then I
                made big progress.
